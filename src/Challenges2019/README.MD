# Advent of Code 2019

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Notes
The solutions were written after the event had concluded. I simply like to solve these puzzles for fun once in a while.
I'm not competing nor writing the most optimized solutions, rather simply programming for fun. It's weird, I know.

Each day is broken into two puzzles. In order to allow each solution to stand on its own, some code may be copied into
the static method for either part, although since my Java understanding has developed since I last attempted this, I will try and use more custom classes in order to restrict redundant code.

Some of the solutions are not optimized to be the most efficient, rather they are just what I thought of at the moment.
I may come back later and rewrite them.
